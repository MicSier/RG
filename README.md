Real Space renormalization group approach to 1D ising model
#
This project originally has been created by me in autumn 2019 during intership in INTiBS, PAN, Wrocław under prof. Józef Sznajd supervision, as exercise in use of Wolfram Mathematica and renormalization group thechnics in statistical mechanics. This repository attempts to recreate it in C++ using symbolicc++ library and hopefully expand upon that.
